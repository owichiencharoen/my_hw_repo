For Q3.6 you could have also looked at it from the perspective of the OR of Prestige 4 vs Non-Prestige 4. Which would have given you the odds of (12/55)/(114/216) = .41 --> For students who attended a 4th tier school the odds of being admitted into gradauate school are 0.41 times the odds of students who did not attend a 4th teir school.
For section 5 the goal was to create/format a new data frame that would look like the dataframe in section 4. Then you were to use the logit model created in section to make predictions on the new dataframe. Unlike the SKlearn model for logistic regression, there isn't a predictproba method for statsmodel.logit(). It is simply a call to the .predict() method. ie. if you tried: combos['admit_pred'] = result.predict(combos[train_cols])... it would've provided you with predicted likelihoods of admission given the input parameters.
