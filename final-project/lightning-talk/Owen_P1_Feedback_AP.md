As mentioned in class, many models will already handle categorical data (despite it being in chinese characters). Although if you wanted to have it converted to something in english, you can use something called the "LabelEncoder" function from SKlearn. Encode your chinese column from 1 to some #, then map it to the translation table you have. Don't lose site of the usefulness of the App data. That might tell you a decent amount of information about what topic that user has interest in, helping to serve better ads.
